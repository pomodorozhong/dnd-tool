# DnD Tool

This tool aims to assist DnD players in managing their combat encounters and streamlining other aspects of their sessions.

My DM thinks the current options are way too complicated and not mobile-friendly, so I’m making a new one that works for us.

## Features

- [ ] Encounter Builder
- [ ] PC Builder
- [ ] NPC Builder
- [ ] Initiative/Combat Tracker
- [ ] Syncing combat state to all players
